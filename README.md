# LocalGov Publications Alpha

This module provides publication content types and configuration for the LocalGov Drupal distribution.

The intention is to support councils to publish publications in accessible html formats rather than in PDF files.

We use Drupal's book module to provide navigation between hierarchically related pages of a publication.

It is also possible to create a single page publication with inline navigation between headings. 

## Alpha release

Please note that this is an alpha release, intented for testing. 

It is not recommended to deploy to production while in alpha, as we changes to data structure and initial configuration are likely. 

## Installing

Once and alpha release is tagged, you should be able to install with the following composer command.

```
composer require localgovdrupal/localgov_publications:^1.0.0-alpha1
```

## Testing
